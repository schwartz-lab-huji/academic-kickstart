<a href='author/roy-schwartz/'>Roy Schwartz</a>'s lab at <a href='http://www.cs.huji.ac.il' target='_blank'>the School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the <a href='http://www.huji.ac.il/' target='_blank'>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a> studies <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>. Our research is driven towards making text understanding technology widely accessible - to doctors, to teachers, to researchers or even to curious teenagers. To be broadly adopted, NLP technology needs to not only be accurate, but also <b>reliable</b>; models should provide explanations for their outputs; and the methods we use to evaluate them need to be convincing. <br> Our lab also studies methods to make NLP technology more <b>efficient</b> and <span style='color:darkgreen'><b>green</b></span>, in order to decrease the environmental impact of the field, as well as lower the cost of AI research in order to broaden participation in it.
