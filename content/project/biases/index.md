title: Biases in Datasets
summary: <div style='text-align:justify'>We analyze the datasets on which NLP models are trained. Looking carefully into these datasets, we uncover <i>limitations</i> and <i>biases</i> in the data collection process as well as the evaluation process. Our findings indicate that the recent success of neural models on many NLP tasks has been <b>overestimated</b>, and  pave the way for the development of <b>more reliable</b> methods of evaluation.
