title: Understanding NLP
summary: <div style='text-align:justify'>In recent years, deep learning became the leading machine learning technology in NLP. Despite its wide adoption in NLP, the theory of deep learning lags behind its empirical success, as many engineered systems are in commercial use without a solid scientific basis for their operation. Our research aims to <b>bridge the gap between theory and practice</b>. We devise mathematical theories that link deep neural models to classical NLP models, such as weighted finite-state automata.
