abstract: "This paper describes University of Washington NLP's submission for the Linking Models of Lexical, Sentential and Discourse-level Semantics (LSDSem 2017) shared task&mdash;the Story Cloze Task. Our system is a linear classifier with a variety of features, including both the scores of a neural language model and style features. We report 75.2% accuracy on the task. A further discussion of our results can be found in Schwartz et al. (2017)."
