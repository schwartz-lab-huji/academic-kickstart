abstract: "Peer reviewing is a central component in the scientific publishing process. We present the first public dataset of scientific peer reviews available for research purposes (PeerRead v1) providing an opportunity to study this important artifact. The dataset consists of 14K paper drafts and the corresponding accept/reject decisions in top-tier venues including ACL, NIPS and ICLR.  The dataset also includes 8.7K textual peer reviews written by experts for a subset of the papers. We describe the data collection process and report interesting observedÂ phenomena in the peer reviews. We also propose two novel NLP tasks based on this dataset and provide simple baseline models. In the first task, we show that simple models can predict whether a paper is accepted with up to 21% error reduction compared to the majority baseline. In the second task, we predict the numerical scores of review aspects and show that simple models can outperform the mean baseline for aspects with high variance such as 'originality' and 'impact'."
